# Nessus Vulnerability Scan â€“ Metasploitable 2

This repository documents a vulnerability assessment project where I used **Tenable Nessus Essentials** to scan a vulnerable machine (**Metasploitable 2**).

The goal was to simulate a real-world vulnerability assessment, identify and prioritize security issues, and document remediation strategies.

---

## Project Workflow

1. **Configured Nessus on Kali Linux**
2. **Scanned Metasploitable 2 in a lab environment**
3. **Exported the report in PDF format**
4. **Reviewed vulnerabilities and severity**
5. **Researched fixes/mitigations for major issues**
6. **Documented the most critical vulnerabilities**
7. **Took screenshots for future reference**

##  Top Critical Vulnerabilities Found

| # | Vulnerability | Severity | Notes |
|--|---------------|----------|-------|
| 1 | SMB Null Sessions | Critical | Allows unauthenticated enumeration |
| 2 | Anonymous FTP Login | High | Open FTP server with full read access |
| 3 | Outdated Services (Apache, Samba, MySQL) | High | Vulnerable versions with public exploits |
| 4 | MySQL Weak Auth | Medium | Weak username/password access |

Details for each are available in: [`doc/critical-vulnerabilities.md`](doc/critical-vulnerabilities.md)
